Singapore River|Sights|1.2873|103.8410|The Singapore River is a river that runs parallel to Alexandra Road and feeds into the Marina Reservoir in the southern part of Singapore. The Singapore River is approximately 3.2 kilometers long from its source at Kim Seng Bridge to where it empties into Marina Bay|The Singapore river extends more than two kilometers beyond its original source at Kim Seng Bridge as Alexandra Canal, as far as the junction of Commonwealth Avenue.The mouth of the Singapore River was the old Port of Singapore, being naturally sheltered by the southern islands. Historically, the city of Singapore initially grew around the port so the river mouth became the centre of trade, commerce and finance. Singapore river has been in Singapore for almost 200 years. Proof of its ancient beginnings lies in the Singapore Stone, which was discovered at the river mouth in 1819 with undecipherable inscriptions. Singapore’s rapid development in its early years was due largely to its strategic location and establishment as an entrepôt port. The port of Singapore traces its origins to the lower reaches of the Singapore River, where it developed and flourished for the first 40 years of the settlement’s history. The river-port’s waterways and quays were hubs of economic activity as flotillas of boats plied its waters, loading and unloading their goods for import or re-export. The river’s inadequate and unsuitable berthing facilities, coupled with the dramatic increase in shipping, led to the eventual development and growth of the New Harbour (later known as Keppel Harbour) \nDeveloper's review: The singapore river has a breathtaking view, especially from the river. I would highly reccomend taking a boat down the river, it trult is a fantastic sight!|TheHoneyCombers.com

Just many activities to do here. I went there to eat and shop. Transport to get here is very easy and fast. The circle and north south line, buses, taxis. People can eat by the sea and enjoy the scenery.There are also many good restaurants along the side facing sentosa. Very nice view. At the very top, there is a children playground, small fountain pool for kids to play. So it is good for family as well. The kids can ride a little train along the seafront area. There is also a cinema if you want to watch a show so other than the hotel, everything is within the mall. Clean and green. Even the outdoor area is nice with artistic statues. \n Opening/Closing Hours: 10am-10pm \n F&B: Macdonalds, Canteen, Many others.|SingaporeGuide.com
